To avoid unnecessary back-and-forth, projects can be structured with a fixed number of revision rounds and a clear feedback system using tools like MarkUp.io, Figma comments, or Google Docs annotations.','Rather than starting from scratch every time, leveraging pre-built design systems, UI kits, and branding templates speeds up the process while maintaining a high level of customization. These frameworks allow for rapid iteration and scalability, ensuring that even complex projects can move forward smoothly.', 'One of the biggest causes of project friction is misaligned expectations—whether about scope, timeline, or deliverables. To prevent this, a detailed onboarding document outlines the entire project structure, including defined milestones and deadlines, clear communication channels with response times, and a well-defined scope of work to eliminate misunderstandings.'];
